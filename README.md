# Immunostaining-and-TIRF-microscopy
My project report for second UGP under Professor Nitin Mohan (course- BSE399A)

In this project, I performed the basics of wet lab work in a microscopy lab- Immunostaining, Cell Viability Assay (MTT assay), and TIRF (Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence) Microscopy..
The location- BioResolution Lab in the BSBE department of IITK is a STORM (Stochastic Optical Microscopy) Lab, and thus, I also learned the basics of STORM.
